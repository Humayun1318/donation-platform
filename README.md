The navbar is designed to be visually appealing and sticky, remaining at the top of the page as the user scrolls. It contains:
- **Logo:** Positioned in the center.
- **"Blog" button:** Positioned on the left side.
- **Account balance:** Displayed on the right side, with a coin icon to signify the balance.
- **"Donation" and "History" buttons:** Positioned in the center of the navbar, toggling between the donation and history sections.

### 2. Donation Section
The donation section includes three donation cards with the following functionality:
- **Donation Cards:** Each card has:
  - An image on the left.
  - A donation title.
  - Donation info.
  - The current donation amount.
  - An input field for the donation amount.
  - A button for submitting the donation.

### 3. History Section
The history section is initially hidden and becomes visible once the user clicks the "History" button. It displays the following transaction information:
- Date and time of the transaction.
- Donation amount.
- Donation name.

### 4. Donation and History Button Functionality
- **Donation Button:** Clicking this button will show the donation cards and hide the history section.
- **History Button:** Clicking this button will show the transaction history and hide the donation section.

### 5. Donation Functionality for Each Card
When the **"Donate Now"** button is clicked:
- The donation amount entered will be deducted from the total account balance.
- The card‚Äôs current donation amount will be updated.
- A meaningful notification will be added to the history section indicating the donation transaction.
- Input validation ensures that the donation amount is valid and does not exceed the available balance.

### 6. Input Validation
Before processing a donation:
- If the amount entered is greater than the account balance, a notification will be shown.
- If the input contains an invalid number (non-numeric input), an alert will notify the user.
- If the input field is empty, the user will be prompted to enter a valid amount.

### 7. Modal on Successful Donation
A static modal is displayed when a donation is successful, confirming the transaction instead of using a browser alert.

### 8. Toggle Active Status
The "Donation" and "History" buttons toggle between active and inactive states, changing color to indicate the current active section.

### 9. Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
